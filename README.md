# JAVA: TP1
## Introduction
This project presents solutions for TP1 in Java, focusing on arrays and string manipulation.

## Exercise 1: Managing Student Grades
- **Sort and display grades**: Grades are input into an array, sorted with `Arrays.sort()`, and then displayed.
- **Calculate average**: The average is computed by summing the grades with a loop and dividing by the number of students usig the method lenght.
- **Max and min grades**: After sorting (with built in function), the first and last grades in the array represent the min and max values.
- **Search for a specific grade**: The program counts the number of students who received a user specified grade by iterating through the array and comparing each element.

## Exercise 2: Conjugation of a First-Group Verb
The program checks if a verb ends with "er," removes the suffix to show its present tense conjugation, and adds the appropriate endings along with the pronouns.
The pronouns and suffix are stored in a 2D array matrix accessed via a loop.
## Exercise 3: String Operations
An interactive menu allows:
- **Input a string**: The user inputs a string that is stored in a variable.
- **Display the string**: Displays the stored string if available.
- **Reverse the string**: Uses `StringBuilder` to reverse the string.
- **Count words**: Counts words by splitting the string by spaces.

## Exercise 4: Counting Letter Occurrences
The program reads a string, ignores case and spaces, then counts and displays the occurrences of each alphabet letter found in the string.
